Most of this repo is not tidy. I mostly submit the files as they were at the end
of the challenge. For round 3 I did some cleanup and started a writeup but
abandoned it. There is no common structure between the rounds. They take place
so rarely that I change my file stucture and naming habits between them.

Enjoy!
